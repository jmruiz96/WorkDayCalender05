# WorkDayCalender05

## Description

- This application was designed to demonstrate Javascript and uses of third party API's.
- There was basic HTML and CSS provided, I built the rows that contain the time, text area and save button.
- Then when the save button is clicked the input from the text area is saved in local storage.
